##### **“Do bank reserves affect interest rates when reserves are abundant?"**
<div style="font-size: 16px"><span style="color:grey">Job Market Paper - <a href="/assets/pdf/fk-langowski_jmp.pdf" target="_blank">Link</a></span></div>
<p style="margin:15px;"></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">An important concern for central banks is how to control short-term interest rates, with the ultimate goal of stabilizing the economy and maintaining price stability. Prior to 2008, the Federal Reserve achieved this by changing the supply of bank reserves in the interbank market. When reserves increased from billions to trillions during and after the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve changed how it implements monetary policy and now uses administered interest rates, notably the interest paid on reserves. In this new policy environment, is there still an impact on short-term rates from changes in reserve supply? And if so, what is the nature of this relationship, and does the impact change over time?</div>
<p style="margin:15px;"></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">I estimate the effect of changes in bank reserves on the federal funds rate spread (a measure of the price of liquidity in the banking system) between 2009 to 2020 while also controlling for changes in the Fed’s policy rates. I test whether the impact of reserve changes depends on overall banking sector liquidity by using threshold models that distinguish between periods of high or low reserve balances. I demonstrate that both changes in reserves and changes in policy rates determine short-term interest rates after 2008, with three key findings. First, for reserves there is a nonlinear relationship: changes in reserves only affect the federal funds spread at lower (though still ample) levels of reserves, but not when they are very high, in line with having differently sloped sections on the reserve demand curve. Second, I find the critical threshold to be time-varying. Third, I find that reserve changes have a stronger effect after the Fed started monetary tightening in 2015. My results show that there is feedback between the Fed’s interest rate and reserve policies, which has important implications for the formulation of current monetary policy.</div>

##### **“Does the impact of monetary policy depend on how that policy is conducted?”**

<div style="text-align: justify">We investigate how the impact of monetary policy depends on the nature of policy implementation. Real output and inflation react differently to Fed interventions during different monetary policy regimes. For example, the policy responses are different during contractionary policy than during expansionary policy.</div>

##### **“Is inflation nonlinear or nonstationary? A cross-country comparison”**
<p style="margin:15px;"></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">Based on nonlinear unit root testing, I find that inflation in six economically advanced countries switches
between a stable, low inflation regime and an unstable regime with high and persistent inflation. Both the estimated threshold values and the speed of transition differ between countries.</div>
