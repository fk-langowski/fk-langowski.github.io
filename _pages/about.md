<div style="text-align: justify"> I am an economist (EP) at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). I obtained my PhD in Economics from the George Washington University in Washington, DC.
<br><br>
My research focuses on monetary economics, central bank procedures, and empirical macroeconomics. I am also interested in nonlinear time series econometrics as well as banking and financial markets. 
<br><br>
Before joining GW, I completed an M.Sc. in Economics at the University of Edinburgh, and received a B.Sc. in International Economics from the University of TÃ¼bingen.
