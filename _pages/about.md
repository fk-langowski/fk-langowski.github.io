<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the George Washington University in Washington, DC. I am on the AEA and EEA job market in 2023/2024.
<br><br>
My research focuses on monetary economics, central bank procedures, and empirical macroeconomics. I am also interested in nonlinear time series econometrics as well as banking and financial markets. 
<br><br>
In my <a href="/assets/pdf/fk-langowski_jmp.pdf" target="_blank">job market paper</a>, I analyze the role of bank reserves for determining short-term interest rates in the ample reserves regime of monetary policy.</div>
<br>
Before joining GW, I completed an M.Sc. in Economics at the University of Edinburgh, and received a B.Sc. in International Economics from the University of TÃ¼bingen.
